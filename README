NAME
    CLASS - Alias for __PACKAGE__

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      use CLASS;

      print CLASS;                  # Foo
      print "My class is $CLASS\n"; # My class is Foo

      sub bar { 23 }

      print CLASS->bar;     # 23
      print $CLASS->bar;    # 23

DESCRIPTION
    CLASS and $CLASS are both synonyms for __PACKAGE__. Easier to type.

    $CLASS has the additional benefit of working in strings.

NOTES
    CLASS is a constant, not a subroutine call. $CLASS is a plain variable,
    it is not tied. There is no performance loss for using CLASS over
    __PACKAGE__ except the loading of the module. (Thanks Juerd)
